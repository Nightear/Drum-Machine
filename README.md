# Drum-Machine
This is a virtual drum machine. It can play the corresponding drum sound when they are clicked.  It supports multi touch. Since the HI hat has different voicing, including the closed sound, open sound and pedal sound, I make it sound differently in different orientation. Therefore, it can generate different variety of drum patterns with only one Hi hat object in the whole drum set. The Hi hat is the first left object in the screen. When the pitch value changes which is fetched by the sensors, the voicing of the Hi hat would be different.
